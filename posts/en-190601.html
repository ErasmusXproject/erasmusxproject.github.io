								<ul class="actions">
									<li><center><img src="../images/photos/190601-b2.jpg" alt="" /></center></li>
									<li><p>This presentation aims to uncover the main differences between online and face-to-face teaching and to present the main aspects that online course design involves. 
									Bearing in mind these purposes, the communication will focus on the proposal of innovative practices for online learning and on the revision of the main aspects to consider when designing an online course.

								<h3>"BEST PRACTICES IN ONLINE TEACHING: A PRACTICAL APPROACH" - Elisa Rojas, UAH</h3>
								<ul class="actions">
									<li><center><img src="../images/photos/190601-b3.jpg" alt="" /></center></li>
									<li><p>Best practices in online teaching require practical training in different aspects such as the management of an advanced agenda and lesson organizer, 
									creating online synchronous meetings and collaborative documents, video use & edition, using web meeting tools with secure connections, 
									or the development for online tools for testing, which are some of the aspects to be revised in this session. <p></li>

								<h3>"Relevant EU professional & labor frameworks to connect HE and labor market" – Luis Fernández, UAH </h3>
								<ul class="actions">
									<li><p>The transition from Higher Education to employment in EU requires a connection between courses and the reality of labor market. 
									One of the commonest problems for this is the absence of a clear reference of occupations and the most required skills and competences with a homogeneous terminology which may serve for reference of HE educators and managers. 
									EU has developed several references to contribute to this link between HE and labor market. One of the main initiatives is ESCO, the official labor classification of EU which will be mandatory in 2021 for all Member States. 
									Another one is the European standard EN16234 for the ICT profession. Additional references from EU funded projects for soft skills will be also explained.  <p></li>

								<h3>"Additional aspects for online training in EU" – Luis Fernández, UAH </h3>
								<ul class="actions">
									<li><p>EU Directive 2016/2101 entered into force on past 23rd September of 2018. 
									It represents an additional aspect of accessibility which should be considered when creating educational materials and online training. 
									Not only as a challenge for IT technicians but for any ICT user which creates digital contents and documents. 
									Simple guidelines may help that everybody can contribute to easier interaction of all users of digital information. 
									This also applies to sophisticated options like video or online assessment.   <p></li>

								<ul class="actions">
									<li><center><img src="../images/photos/190601-b7.jpg" alt="" /></center></li>
									<li><p>The “Basic Business” e-learning content on the Open edX platform was designed to develop seven business competences – actuality, technology, marketing, competition, finances, risks, and the ability to implement business ideas. Our recent research on collaborative e-learning in student teams embraces knowledge flows and the characteristics of  knowledge in a collaborative e-learning system. 
									The objective of the study was to find out the factors affecting the knowledge flow and the stickiness differences among various types of knowledge, including the stickiness of knowledge, student motivation, and the influence of peer-reviews on each skill; 
									the impact of peer-reviews on the development of the students’ competences; the assessment of the quality of each student’s given and received review and its correlation with the student’s achievements in developing his/her business idea. 
									The study results of every evaluated skill show that there are differences among knowledge types, their stickiness and impact on the students’ motivation and cooperation.  <p></li>
